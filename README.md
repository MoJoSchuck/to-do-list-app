# ToDoList App

This is a simple ToDoList web application where users can add, cross out, and delete tasks. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with jQuery for enhanced interactivity.

## Features

- **Add Task**: Users can add new tasks to the list by entering text into the input field and clicking the "Add" button.
- **Cross Out Task**: Tasks can be marked as completed by double-clicking on them, applying a strike-through style.
- **Delete Task**: Each task includes a delete button ("X") that allows users to remove it from the list.
- **Reorder Tasks**: Tasks can be reordered by dragging and dropping them within the list.

## Usage

To use the application, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. Enter a task in the input field and click "Add" to add it to the list. Double-click on a task to mark it as completed, and click on the delete button ("X") to remove it from the list.

## Dependencies

The application requires jQuery and jQuery UI for drag-and-drop functionality. These dependencies are included via CDN links in the HTML file.
